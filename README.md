HWIOAuthBundle
==============

The HWIOAuthBundle adds support for authenticating users via oauth in Symfony2. The bundle was forked of [KnpOAuthBundle](https://github.com/KnpLabs/KnpOAuthBundle) with consent of the primary maintainer [ubermuda](https://github.com/ubermuda) in order to push the bundle forward faster as original creator currently didn't have the desired time for it.
